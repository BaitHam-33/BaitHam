The website have three users: 
* Adopters - the regular user, annonymos user, this user can read articles and success stories, donate to the shelter, view the animals available for adoption, adopt an animal,
reoprt for an abuse or missing animal, view reports (like how many animals in the shelter and more), get info about upcoming event and ask question in the forum.
* Volunteer - the staff at shelter, have more permissions compare to the adopters. The staff can see all the pages like the adopter but can do more things for example: 
to add/edit/delete an animal to/from the database, also the volunteers have a Task board in it they can see all the "to do task" and assign themself for a task. The Volunteers 
can log in to their account and report thier attandence, Moreover they can download all kind of useful reports to their computers. Beside that they can respond in forum and respond
to a report made by adopter.
* Manager- the manager of the shelter is the person with all the permissions, he create users in the database (the volunteer users), he can download all the reports, view evrything
and control the database, edit objects, create objects and delete them. The manger creates the tasks for the volunteers to see.
